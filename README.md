# Coconut React Renderer

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/MVCoconut/Lobby)

This is a base library facilitating the rendering of coconut views through React. It's not meant for direct use, but rather is used as a dependency for:

- [`coconut.react-dom`](https://github.com/MVCoconut/coconut.react-dom/): Renders coconut using React and react-dom (also works with Preact).
- [`coconut.react-native`](https://github.com/MVCoconut/coconut.react-native/): Renders coconut using React Native.
