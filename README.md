# Coconut React Renderer

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/MVCoconut/Lobby)

Render Coconut apps through React.

Requires external component definitions such as [haxe-react-native](https://github.com/haxe-react/haxe-react-native)

## Example

#### React Native

https://github.com/MVCoconut/examples-react-native

#### React Web

Call for contribution.

## TODO

#### React Web

Direct React web support is not yet available due to the lack of the full definition of the DOM components ([example](https://github.com/MVCoconut/coconut.react/blob/721458b/src/coconut/react/Renderable.hx#L42-L46))

However, one can use react-native-web over react-native to target web browsers.
